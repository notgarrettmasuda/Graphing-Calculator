Version 1.01
- Implemented:
  - Now shows specific functions on the side while being able to delete specific ones
  - tried to make as user friendly as possible

- Bugs:
  - Can't do negative numbers by themself
  - Has some weird interactions with parenthesis
  - However I found a temporary issue in making the tokenator start with 0 + an item unless it starts with a negative. Although this doesn't solve the issue if the user had another negative number within there function it only works if they start with a negative number
